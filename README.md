# About

password generator is a tool that automatically generates a strong and unpredictable password for each of your accounts.

<br>

## Guidelines :

-  Variable Character Length

- Mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.

- Mixture of letters and numbers. 

- Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., @ #?]
    - Note: do not use < or > in your password, as both can cause       problems in Web browsers.
    (Student is free to decide the input and output layout for this mini project)
